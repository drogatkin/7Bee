<h2>Purpose</h2>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
Being GitHub project, 7Bee doesn't offer binaries so they should be build. 7Bee is self building tool, however if you build it
first time, you need bootstrap it. You can use either bootstrap or bootstrap.bat accordingly your platform. Needless to remind
that 7Bee is Java application so you have to have Java version 7 or better installed.
Therefore before running bootstrap script, you need to specify right path to your JDK. Open bootstrap script in any text
editor and specify correct value of environmennt variable JAVA_HOME. Now you can launch the script and if everything right, then
bee.jar will be created in lib directory. However before using 7Bee, it is recommended to install it.
